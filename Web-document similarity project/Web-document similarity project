- Building on your previous Python project
- Count the frequency of every word (a word is a sequence of alphanumeric characters, case does NOT matter) in the body of your document
- Write a 64 bit hash function for a word using polynomial rolling hash function
       hash(s) = s[0] + s[1].p  + s[2].p^2   + ..... + s[n-1].p^(n-1)   mod n       

Here s[i] is the ASCII for letter i in a word, use p = 53 and m = p2^64
Compute Simhash for the document (as shown in slide 57)
Modify your program to take two URLs from the web on the command line, print how many bits are common in their simhashes.
