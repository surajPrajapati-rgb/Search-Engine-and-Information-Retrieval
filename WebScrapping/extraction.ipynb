They believe that the world will end when the stone falls. The area features a chain of rocks or a ridge that appears to be a silhouette of a man lying on his back, which is said to represent a person from the legend known as \"Sleeping Sayan\".2 Local legend states that when the stone falls into Lake Raduzhnoye, the Sleeping Sayan will wake up. Another legend teaches that the monolithic stone is the heart of the Sleeping Sayan.3 People say that the stone vibrates, which is evidence of the beating heart.4 Some people also believe that the rock may represent the Russian mythical hero Svyatogor.4\\nSeveral groups of tourists have tried to dislodge the landmark by pushing it down the mountain, but without any success.4 Some people have even brought winches and jacks to try to dislodge the stone.4 It did not move at all; it is held on with stone chips supporting its base.3 The area also experiences frequent earthquakes, but the stone has not moved as of 2024.5\\nThe Hanging Stone, Western Sayan, Ergaki mountains\\nThe stone is perched on a precipice, giving the impression that it may fall. The weight of the stone is estimated at 500 tons.1 It is positioned approximately 1,000m (3,300ft) above the lake. The stone is 15m (49ft) long.6 At one time the stone reportedly swayed, but over time grooves became clogged and froze the stone in one place.4 \\nThere is a trail leading to the stone that can be navigated between June and September. The trail is 12km (7.5mi) long and takes five to seven hours. The Ergaki Nature Park charges 4,800 rubles for a guided tour to visit the stone.7 The weather in the region changes quickly and can even receive snowfall in the month of June.8\\n  2024.\\n  2024.\\n  2024.\\n  2024.\\n  2024.\\n  2024.\\n  2024.\\n  2024.\\nWikimedia Commons has media related to .\\n --\\nRetrieved from \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hanging_Stone&amp;oldid=1204328166\"\\nCategories: Landforms of Krasnoyarsk KraiSayan MountainsIndividual rocksTourist attractions in SiberiaHidden categories: CS1 Russian-language sources (ru)Articles with short descriptionShort description is different from WikidataUse dmy dates from January 2024Articles containing Russian-language textCoordinates on WikidataPages using Infobox landform with no typeCommons category link is on Wikidata\\n This page was last edited on 6 February 2024, at 22:48.\\nText is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0;\\nadditional terms may apply.
