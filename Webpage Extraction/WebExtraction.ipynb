There is tremendous potential and talent in these children, all they need is access to good education. At the Sitare Foundation, we believe in providing access to high quality education to the most talented underprivileged children in our society. We have embarked upon a humble mission. Our mission is to “Transform fifty thousand lives through education by 2050.”\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n Get in touch\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n Barack Obama\\r\\n 44th President of the United States\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \"The best anti-poverty program is a world-class education.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n Transforming Lives\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n Mahendra was born and raised in a small town, Chohtan in Barmer District, Western Rajasthan. His father works in a sheet metal factory rolling stainless steel sheets. His elder brother also works in the same factory. They have a very large family to support, and if Mahendra didn\\'t get an opportunity to study in Sitare Foundation, he would probably be working in the same factory today to support his family. \"I got an opportunity to be a part of the organization where I met some of the most motivated young people, who were nurtured by the Sitare Foundation to dream higher.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n Kusum is a poor farmer\\'s daughter. Her family does not own the land they farm, they just work there, while the landowner keeps the lion share of the earnings. They only get 30 cents on a dollar of crops sold. \\r\\n \"In my community, women are seldom sent to school, but my parents believe in education. They knew that education, especially women\\'s education, is the only way out of generational poverty. For me, the path to education was never easy. From a young age, I have contributed to the farm work, from milking cows, to cooking, tilling the fields, I did whatever was needed to help my family.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n Milan comes from a life of adversity. His father is an auto-rickshaw driver who works day and night to make ends meet. In his auto-rickshaw, Milan\\'s father used to take several affluent kids to school everyday, and outside that private school, he used to shake his head thinking his children will never be able to go to such a good school. All that changed when Milan was selected into the Sitare Foundation. Today his father proudly brings his son to the same school sometime in his auto-rickshaw. \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n Nisha was born and brought up in a small village, Chawandiya (population 2,140) in Nagaur District, Rajasthan. Nisha\\'s father is a farmer and her mother is a housewife who also helps at the farm. Her entire family works on the farm. Nisha had never seen life outside her village until she entered the Sitare program in Jodhpur. And now, she is going places.\\r\\n \"Joining the Sitare Foundation was a turning point in my life. Having lived my entire life in a small village, in a family of poor farmers, I moved to the city and started going to an international school.\"\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n Urmila was born and raised in a small town in Jodhpur District, Western Rajasthan.
